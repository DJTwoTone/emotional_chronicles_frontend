                        First, you will see some randomly selected feelings. Go ahead a click on the ones that you are feeling today
                        Next, take a look at the writing prompt.
                        If you don't like it, go ahead and click for a new one.

                        When we get the analysis back, we'll do a little dance, make a little love, and math down the numbers.
                        We'll then show you what emotions your writing might be showing.
